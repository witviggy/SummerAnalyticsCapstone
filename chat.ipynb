      "* **New Plans Effective Date:** The new plans go into effect on **July 3rd, 2024**.\n",
      "* **JioBharat/JioPhone Unaffected:** Tariffs for these plans remain unchanged, emphasizing affordability for feature phone users.\n",

      "**New Applications (Free for a year):**\n",

      "* **JioTranslate:** AI-powered multilingual translation for voice, text, and images - regular price Rs 99/month.\n",
      "\n",
